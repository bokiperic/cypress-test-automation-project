# Cypress TestRunner

After installing the Cypress and node_modules, you can run *Cypress TestRunner* by running the command ```node_modules/.bin/cypress open```. <br/>

After this step Cypress will add some folders and example tests to your project. Try running the tests in the ```examples``` folder or add your own test files to ```cypress/integration```.
